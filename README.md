# langsci-fonts
These are the fonts used in our publications. `fontspec.cfg` contains all the necessary settings to use the fonts in `fonts/` in a book project. This setup is configured to work with the *flat* variant of `langscibook`. You do not need to apply the settings in this repository if you use the `nonflat` variant.
